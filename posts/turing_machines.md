Recently I've been reading Roger Penrose's 1989 book **The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds and The Laws of Physics.** The book's central theme is Roger putting forward his thoughts on the question of whether human conciousness is algorithmic, and can therefore be modelled using digital computers.
