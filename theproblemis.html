    <h1 id="the-problem-is">The Problem Is...</h1>
    <p>Picture this. It&#39;s 4pm on a Friday and you&#39;re stuck in a Teams meeting you&#39;re barely paying attention
      to.
      As you&#39;re about to phase out of consciousness your coworker drops the coldest line you&#39;ve ever heard:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;See, the problem is...&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You feel butterflies in your stomach at the prospect of the problem finally being identified. You want to cry,
      laugh, hug a family member, high five a stranger - something to release this overwhelming surge of emotions.</p>
    <p>You need a distraction, so you go to <a
        href="https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/">old.reddit.com/r/programming</a> and mindlessly click the first
      post you see. The top comment is from a distinguished scholar you recognise, one u/shartboi420. His comment starts
      with &quot;I think the problem is...&quot;. A cold sweat emerges as you begin to notice a pattern. Two problems
      identified in one day. Is this even possible?</p>
    <hr>
    <p>What sparked this post was seeing some variation of the phrase &quot;the problem is...&quot; five times in a
      single work day. When I thought the worst was over me Reddit delivered the coup de gr√¢ce. Now I was determined to
      find out how many problems have been identified on /r/programming and who exactly is the best problem identifier.
    </p>
    <p>First I would need access to the dataset of all comments on /r/programming. At a glance <a
        href="https://pushshift.io/signup">Pushshift</a> seemed like the right choice, except they require that
      you&#39;re a moderator and unfortuntely life hasn&#39;t been so kind to me yet.</p>
    <p>After some digging around I came across this very helpful <a
        href="https://old.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/1itme1k/separate_dump_files_for_the_top_40k_subreddits/">post
        by u/Watchful1.</a> It&#39;s a torrent with a dump file for the submissions and comments of the top 40 thousand
      most popular subreddits, exactly what I needed. It seems to be a fairly complete dataset from the start of Reddit
      until the end of 2024. They even generously included a <a
        href="https://github.com/Watchful1/PushshiftDumps/blob/master/scripts/filter_file.py">script</a> that after some
      slight modification did exactly what I needed.</p>
    <p>After downloading the comments for /r/programming and slightly modifying the script to search for occurences of
      &quot;the problem is&quot;, I was finally ready. </p>
    <p>I started the script and 81 seconds later had produced my life&#39;s work. <a
        href="the_problem.csv">the_problem.csv</a>. It&#39;s a CSV containing every problem identified on
      /r/programming, around <strong>36,267</strong> in total. The overall number of comments scanned was
      <strong>8,056,545</strong>, meaning that comments containing &quot;the problem is&quot; make up approximately
      <strong>0.45%</strong> of all /r/programming comments. I&#39;m not sure if this is higher or lower than I
      expected, but it still feels like too many.</p>
    <p>So now I know how many problems have been identified, but now I want to know who&#39;s identifying them. So lets
      get the top 10 problem identifiers (including u/[deleted]). Fortunately this was trivial using Python.</p>
    <pre><code>import csv
from collections import Counter

counts = Counter()

with open(&quot;the_problem.csv&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;) as f:
  reader = csv.reader(f)
  for row in reader:
    counts[row[2]] += 1

# The top is always u/[deleted].
# So we get the top 11 instead.
top_11 = counts.most_common(11)

for value, count in top_11:
  print(f&quot;{value}: {count}&quot;)</code></pre>
    <p>Drumroll please...</p>

    <p>Congratulations to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/user/grauenwolf">u/grauenwolf</a>, you&#39;re the winner of
      the coveted title of Chief Problem Identifier! The problem is I have nothing to give you. Also well done to our
      runner ups, keep at it and we&#39;ll be out of problems in no time.</p>

      <li>Yes, this is a non-serious shitpost born out of frustration at a common turn of phrase.</li>
      <li>You&#39;re right, it isn&#39;t rigorous and I didn&#39;t accomodate for false positives and quoted replies.
