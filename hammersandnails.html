    </blockquote>
    <p>I had a small problem. I recently went through some bookmarks I had made last year only to discover a large portion of them now 404. For some of the sites this wasn&#39;t a huge issue as I could simply just use the <a href="http://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>, but there were a few that don&#39;t seem to have been backed up anywhere. This is a shame.</p>
    <p>What I needed was something that could:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Keep a list of webpages I want to bookmark.</li>
    <li>Create a snapshot of the webpage when I bookmark it.</li>
    <li>Serve the webpage archive back to me.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Being the professional webshit that I am, I immediately started solutionising.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>I need to build a web application.</li>
    <li>The web application needs to be interactive and easy to extend, so with my experience in React it felt like an obvious choice.</li>
    <li>I need a database to store bookmark information, and given I&#39;ve used Postgres in the past why would I choose something else?</li>
    <li>Deploying it could be a little awkward so I need to containerise the project using Docker. </li>
    <li>I need to host this somewhere so I could use my Raspberry Pi.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Luckily before I went down any of these ill informed rabbit holes I realised I was doing was stupid. It was as clear as day. </p>
    <p><em>&quot;This could be a shell script.&quot;</em></p>
    <p>And so it was.</p>

    <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>I spend all day writing web services, so it felt like building a fully fledged web application was a very natural solution to the problem at hand. This was a fallacy. The amount of complexity in the initial solution was magnitudes higher than the problem ever justified, and I had fell into the psychological trap that Maslow had articulated nearly 60 years ago. </p>
    <p>I&#39;m not kicking myself over it, but it&#39;s a good reminder to take stock of your mental hammers. It also highlights how important it is to have a good repertoire of tools at hand as it&#39;s your tools that ultimately define your approach to solving problems. </p>
